# csit-scripting

a script used for the midterm of my csit ethical hacking class

this python script uses the os library's popen to execute a shell command.
it runs the ping command with some address input by the user.
uses find to look for 'ttl' and uses that to determine if the ping was successful or not.

comments in this code are from the guide that was given inorder to complete this scripting assignment.
